I'm Onur Yildiz, an engineering student at Simon Fraser University with a knack for building things, solving problems, and leading teams. I’ve always been passionate about hands-on projects that combine creativity with technology, whether it’s designing an electric go-kart from a shopping cart or simulating hardware systems in VHDL. I thrive in collaborative environments where we push the limits of what’s possible.

One of my proudest projects was designing the drivetrain for an electric go-kart. Starting from scratch, I tackled the challenges of integrating a power delivery system that worked within the structural limitations of a shopping cart—a fun and technically demanding problem that tested my engineering skills. On another project, I led a team to create a fall detection device, combining hardware and software to help at-risk individuals. Both experiences taught me the value of teamwork, creativity, and technical precision.

I'm always looking to refine my skills and take on new challenges, with the ultimate goal of becoming an engineer who not only designs innovative products but also leads teams to success. In my free time, you’ll probably find me collecting vinyl records, building with LEGO, or catching up on Formula 1.
