I am Onur Yildiz, a dedicated and adaptable individual with a strong foundation in both academics and the service industry. As a recent graduate from a French Immersion Program and a current engineering student at Simon Fraser University, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. With two years of experience at Cineplex, I have been recognized as 'Employee of the Month' and 'Most Valuable Cast Member of the Year'. In addition, my two years of volunteer work demonstrate my commitment to giving back to the community. I am a quick learner, a team player, and have a high degree of tech literacy. During my current role as a team leader in an engineering design lab, I ensured tasks were completed with precision, and I took pride in my commitment to never making the same mistake twice. Looking ahead in my professional life, my goal is to become an engineer who not only designs exceptional products but also leads high-performing teams.

To get to know me better some of my hobbies include

- Collecting vinyl as a huge lover of music
- Building Lego
- Playing online games casually with my friends
- Following Formula 1 as best I can from North America
