I am Onur Yildiz, an engineering student at Simon Fraser University with a passion for problem-solving and hands-on projects. My academic journey in computer engineering, coupled with my personal projects, has allowed me to develop strong technical skills in programming, design, and teamwork. I have a unique blend of creativity and technical knowledge, making me highly adaptable and quick to learn new technologies.

## Technical Experience

### Electric Shopping Go Kart

**Duration:** June - September 2024  
**Description:**  
I designed and constructed the drivetrain for an electric go-kart made from a repurposed shopping cart. Working alongside my team, I planned the drivetrain and power delivery system from the ground up, ensuring compatibility with the structural constraints of the cart. My contributions included design integration, troubleshooting, and testing to ensure optimal functionality and reliability of the final product.

### VHDL Sim with Quartus Prime & ModelSim

**Duration:** September 2024 - Present  
**Description:**  
In this project for the Fundamentals of Digital Logic & Design course, I simulated VHDL programs using Quartus Prime and ModelSim. I conducted functional and timing analysis, optimized hardware performance, and validated designs through simulations. I also collaborated with teammates to integrate VHDL modules and troubleshoot issues, ensuring a robust system before hardware synthesis.

### iFallen - Software Team Lead

**Duration:** September - December 2023  
**Description:**  
As the software team lead for a fall detection device project, I developed the microcontroller's fall detection algorithm using Python. I also designed and soldered the circuit, ensuring robust hardware functionality. I led a team of seven to develop a wearable device that enhances safety for at-risk individuals by automatically calling for help in case of a fall.

## Goals

My professional goal is to become a proficient engineer, capable of designing innovative products and leading teams to solve complex technical challenges.
