**Status:** In Progress  
**Current Focus:** CAD Modeling  

## Project Overview

I am designing and building a **custom digital camera** using a **Raspberry Pi 3** and the **Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera Module**. This project involves modeling the entire assembly in **SolidWorks**, constructing a functional enclosure, and developing a **Python-based GUI** for real-time image capture.  

## Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with **optical systems and digital imaging**.  
- Design a **custom camera housing** using **CAD and 3D printing**.  
- Develop a **software interface** for interacting with the camera module.  

## Current Progress  

### **CAD Modeling** (In Progress)  

I am currently designing the **camera enclosure in SolidWorks**, ensuring precise placement for the **Raspberry Pi, camera module, and display**. The model accounts for accessibility, durability, and future expansion.  

### **Next Steps**  

- **Construction:** 3D-print and assemble the enclosure.  
- **Programming:** Develop a **Python-based GUI** for image capture and preview.  
- **Testing & Refinement:** Optimize the design for stability and usability.  

## Future Plans  

Once the initial build is complete, I plan to explore:  

- **Battery power integration** for portability.  
- **Advanced image processing techniques** for improved functionality.  
- **Enclosure refinements** to enhance ergonomics and durability.  

This project blends my interests in **optics, CAD modeling, and embedded systems**, providing hands-on experience in building a **functional digital imaging device from scratch**.
