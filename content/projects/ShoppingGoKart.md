**Role:** Drivetrain

## Project Overview

Myself and a group of friends worked together over the summer to build an electric go-kart from a repurposed shopping cart. We held weekly meetings to plan and execute the project, designing and integrating all systems from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn about electric vehicle power systems and drivetrain integration
- Apply mechanical design principles within unique constraints
- Collaborate effectively with a team to solve engineering challenges

## Inspiration

We were inspired by a desire to repurpose everyday items, like shopping carts, into something creative and functional. This project was a fun challenge to see how we could turn a simple cart into a working electric go-kart.

## What It Does

The electric shopping go-kart is a fully functional, electrified vehicle capable of moving under its own power. It features a custom-built drivetrain that works within the structural constraints of a shopping cart and delivers power smoothly to enable the cart to drive.

## Development Process

We followed a structured approach to develop the electric go-kart:

1. Brainstormed project ideas and decided on repurposing a shopping cart.
2. Researched electric drivetrains and power delivery systems.
3. Designed the drivetrain and integrated it into the shopping cart frame.
4. Held weekly team meetings to refine the design and address challenges.
5. Assembled and tested the completed electric shopping go-kart.

### My Contributions

- Designed the drivetrain system from scratch, considering the limitations of the shopping cart.
- Developed and integrated the power delivery system.
- Collaborated with team members to ensure smooth drivetrain integration with the overall vehicle.
- Assisted in troubleshooting and improving the reliability of the final design.

## Key Learnings

I gained hands-on experience with designing and implementing electric drivetrains, and learned how to balance technical constraints with creativity. Working as part of a team on this project taught me how to communicate effectively and solve complex problems through collaboration.
