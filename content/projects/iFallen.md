**Role:** Software Team Lead

## Project Overview

My team of seven and I were tasked with identifying a problem and designing an innovative solution.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a solution tailored to a specific problem.
- Grasp the fundamentals of design and engineering.

## Inspiration

Concern for my grandmother's safety when home alone inspired the concept. This concern extended to our team’s focus on creating a device to aid anyone at risk of falling.

## What It Does

The iFallen device is built around a microcontroller and an accelerometer. It detects falls using a highly customizable threshold approach. If a fall is detected, a text message is sent to a designated contact after a short delay. The device includes a button that can cancel the alert if the user is unharmed.

## Development Process

We divided our team into four specialized groups:

1. **Management Team:** Kept the project on schedule and managed component procurement.
2. **Presentation Team:** Prepared and delivered presentations throughout the semester.
3. **Software Team:** Focused on programming and developing the fall detection algorithm.
4. **Design & Modeling Team:** Responsible for the device’s exterior design and housing.

### My Contributions

- **Software Development:** Led the software team in programming the microcontroller using Python. Developed the fall detection algorithm and designed the device's logic.
- **Hardware Design:** Designed and soldered the circuit.
- **Team Collaboration:** Worked closely with my team to ensure integration of ideas across all groups, enhancing the final product.

## Key Learnings

This project honed my teamwork skills, particularly in resolving differences with teammates to find the best solutions. Collaborative problem-solving not only improved our project outcomes but also boosted team morale and excitement.
