[{"content":"Myself and seven others were tasked with finding a problem and designing its solution.\nLearning Objectives # Design a solution around a problem. Understand the fundamentals of design. Inspiration #With my grandmother staying with my family I found it very easy to worry about her when we were not home. I extened this sentiment to the team and expanded it to anyone who may be at risk of falling.\nWhat it does #At the core of the iFallen is a microcontroller and an accelerometer. The microcontroller reads data from the accelerometer and determines a if a fall has occured using a exremely custimizable thershold approach. After a short period of time, a text is sent to a loved one\u0026rsquo;s phone. A button is also included on the device which can be pressed in that short period to let the device know you are okay and the text can be canceled.\nHow we built it #We spilt the group into 4 teams.\nManagment team Presentation team Software team Design \u0026amp; Modeling team My role in the group was to lead the software team, I programmed the microcontroller with Python, worked on the fall detection aligorithm, and design the device\u0026rsquo;s logic. My teamate helped on the aligorithm and programmed the communication between the microcontroller and phone. In addition to my resposibilites in the software, I also designed and soldered the circuit. The management team kept us on a desriable pace and would order the needed components. The presentation team would work on the presentations we had throughout the semester. The design and modeling team were responsibile for the exterior and housing of the device. Though we were in our own teams the group worked together as often as we could. This allowed ideas to be spread across teams to keep us inspired.\nWhat I learned #This experience pushed me to learn how to work with others. It was common that my teammate and I would not agree on the best approach but working with him on these problems and finding the best solution not only boosted our moral and made us excited to work on the project more but resulted in a better final product.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/ifallen/","section":"projects","summary":"Myself and seven others were tasked with finding a problem and designing its solution.","title":"iFallen"},{"content":"Hey there!
